# stock-analysis

Module 2 practices

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to refactor the VBA code for Steve, making the code more efficient and readable, so they can have all the trends of the trends in a glance. We made 2 different analysis, one taking only DQ stocks, and the second one a more complete table with all of the stocks, using VBA.

## Results:
* First, following the steps in the module, in which we learned how to use the different techniques to start coding. For me, it was easier to name my own variables with names that I can relate them in a future, and to understand better the variables.

* Using VBA is very useful to process information in a more efficient/quick way, using formats, and the button, might be very helpful for all who are interested to see the analysis with just one click.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code in general.
### I think there are more advantages than disadvantages by refactoring a code, first the code will run fastier due to efficiency, the code will look cleaner and more organized.

### The main disadvantage that I found is that it takes much time, to analyze and reestrucutre all the code.
